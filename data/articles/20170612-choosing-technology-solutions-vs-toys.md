When choosing technologies, programmers need be wary that they focus on
choosing the best tool to solve the problem, and not the "coolest" or the "newest" toy to play with.

> Your goal should be to "solve" the problem mostly within the problem domain, not the solution domain.
    
Too often a technology is chosen because the bigger companies *(e.g. Google)* are using it.
  
> ... if you’re using a technology that originated at a large company, but your use case is very different,
> it’s unlikely that you arrived there deliberately; no, it’s more likely you got there
> through a ritualistic belief that imitating the giants would bring the same riches.

All aspects of a technology needs to be considered and not just the selling points.
There are always trade-offs, but they are discussed far less often than the benefits.

> Determine what was de-prioritized to achieve what was prioritized.

> Even Google isn't Google ... What’s important is that you actually use the right tool for the job.
> Google knows this well: once they decided that MapReduce wasn’t the right tool for building the index, they stopped using it.

Ozan proposes the acronym **UNPHAT**
as an aid for ensuring that a technology is being chosen for the right reasons:

    
- <u>***U**nderstand*</u> the problem before considering solutions.
- <u>*e**N**umerate*</u> multiple candidate solutions for consideration, to avoid playing favorites.
- <u>***P**aper*</u> i.e. read each candidate's paper/documentation to understand
  *what it was designed for*.
- <u>***H**istorical context*</u> in which the candidate was designed is important for understanding
  *why it was created*.
- <u>***A**dvantages and disadvantages*</u> need to be weighed against each other.
- *<u>**T**hink</u> (and really think!)* about how well each candidate solution fits the problem at hand.
  *Understand what would need to be different for you to change your mind.*
    


#### Conclusion

Ensure that you're prioritizing solutions over toys when choosing a technology.

Use Ozan's **UNPHAT** acronym to double check yourself during the decision process.
