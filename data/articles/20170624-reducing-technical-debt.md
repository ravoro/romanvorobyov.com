Tech debt is something everybody has but few want to deal with, especially when there are other business priorities at stake.

As a result, tech debt builds up and is usually not addressed until after it is too late and damage is done *forcing* a solution to be put in place.

Often times the reason that tech debt grows is that people simply don't know how big it actually is. *It is abstract.*

And it is hard to solve a problem when it is not clear what the problem is in the first place.

Erik suggests precisely that, the first step in reducing technical debt should be transforming it from something abstract to something measurable.

> ... fight tech debt by **visibly measuring** it.

> Just go put a figure to it so that you can **watch that figure change** as you do your work

Once the tech debt is measurable, it becomes more visible and will be less likely to grow too big without notice.
   
> If you wring your hands over the particulars, your tech debt will remain **forever unquantified** and thus abstract.
> 
> But if you write up on the big board that you have 225 days of tech debt when yesterday’s figure had only 200,
> people are going to notice. Discussions will start. Suddenly, the tech debt becomes everyone’s problem.
