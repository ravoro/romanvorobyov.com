title: Agile Estimation: Story Points vs. Time

<header id="article-header" markdown="1">   
This article is my thoughts on agile estimation using story points (and their relation to time).
</header>

Agile task estimation encourages the use of story points instead of time (e.g. hours) as a unit of measure.

<!--
In reality though, it can be difficult for us developers not to succumb to linking points to time _(e.g. 1pt = 1hr)_,
especially when we are under the pressure of time-sensitive deadlines that require us to accomplish tasks within a given amount of time.
 -->

This may seem like a confusing and unnecessary complexity,
especially when considering the natural link between tasks and time (i.e. it takes time to complete a task).
Why then would anyone use story points?

Compared to time-based estimates, story points provide a higher-level abstraction for estimating tasks by focusing on the **effort** needed to accomplish a task.
This provides for a more forgiving (and more human) alternative to simply measuring tasks with time _(which is low-level, basic and rigid)_.

Story points offer the following benefits over simple time-based estimates:

- Acknowledge that developers have different levels of experience and work at different speeds.

> Story points allow team members with different skill levels to communicate about and agree on an estimate.

> Not all developers work at the same speed on the same tasks...
> It is unlikely that all developers have equal experience and familiarity [with the codebase]...
> Story points help normalize the estimate of a task by creating a consistent metric for a task independent of the person working on it.

- Encourage developers to focus on accomplishing the task, instead of meeting a deadline.  

> Worrying about finishing a task on time can limit a developerâ€™s ability (or willingness) to bring up more time consuming options.
> Story points abstract units of time to help prevent people from worrying about finishing a task in a period of time.
> With that worry gone, the conversation is focused solely on the complexity of a task and the options available.

It's important to understand that story points are simply an alternative approach to time-based estimation
and may not be the best choice for all situations.
It's ultimately for you to decide what form of estimation better fits the nature of your project.
